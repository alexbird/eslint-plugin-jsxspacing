eslint-plugin-jsxspacing
========================

An eslint rule to line jsx things up vertically, so they look prettier to people who like that sort of thing ;p E.g. unreformed C++ programmers. 

*Just to be clear, I don't think this helps clarity at all, but I was working with someone who decreed it, and I really wanted to automate the sh!t out of it. They didn't like this in the end because it didn't use hard tabs for alignment* ðŸ˜­

This plugin aims to implement a eslint rule like ``object-spacing``, but for JSX properties.

It is currently a proof of concept that relies on the code already being sensibly formatted, e.g. by running prettier-eslint
